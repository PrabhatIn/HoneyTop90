# HoneyTop90: A 90-line MATLAB code for topology optimization using honeycomb tessellation
The source code (HoneyTop90.m) provides an efficient, simple and compact way to generate honeycomb tessellation and topology optimization. The symmetric MBB beam is the default design domain in the HoneyTop90.m code. The other extensions are provided in the paper "HoneyTop90: A 90-line MATLAB code for topology optimization using honeycomb tessellation", Optimization and Engineering Journal, 2022 (in press). We also provide HoneyGen.m code which generates honeycomb tessellation (element connectivity, nodal coordiantes) for the readers who wish to generate hexagonal elements for other applications.
